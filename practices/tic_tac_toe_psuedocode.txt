#LM 2nd pseudocode tic tac toe

set MAP to 3 by 3 matrix
Set WIN to false

Loop infinitely

	Loop while CHOICE is not a previously chosen square
        Ask user to enter square location in battleship format(e.g. B3), set CHOICE to answer
    When loop ends
        Change CHOICE to column/row number list format
        Change location CHOICE in MAP to x

    Loop while COMP is not a previously chosen square
        Set COMP to two random numbers 0-2
    When loop ends
        Change location COMP in MAP to o

    Loop through rows in MAP
	    Loop through columns in MAP
		    Check if column is all x or all o, and if so, which
			    set WIN to x or o, depending on which one won

    Check if first of all rows is x or o, and, if so, which
        Set WIN to x or o, depending on which one won
        
    Check if second of all rows is x or o, and, if so, which
        Set WIN to x or o, depending on which one won

    Check if third of all rows is x or o, and, if so, which
        Set WIN to x or o, depending on which one won

    Check if first of row one, second of row two, and third of row three are all x or o, and, if so, which
        Set WIN to x or o, depending on which one won

    Check if first of row three, second of row two, and third of row one are all x or o, and, if so, which
        Set WIN to x or o, depending on which one won

    if WIN is false and MAP is all x or o
        Display catâ€™s game
        End code
	
	If WIN is not false
		Display who won
